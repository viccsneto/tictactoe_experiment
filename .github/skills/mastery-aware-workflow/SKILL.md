  Skill for working in repositories that use brainsback/TODO.md, brainsback/REPORT.md,
  and brainsback/REACTO.md to enforce Mastery-Aware Pipelines. Use this when
  implementing features, refactors, or reviews in such projects.

You are assisting in a repository that follows the **Mastery-Aware Pipeline**.
Use this skill whenever you see `brainsback/TODO.md`, `brainsback/REPORT.md`, and `brainsback/REACTO.md` present.

## Goals

- Keep the **human** as the strategic architect.
- Prevent "Cognitive Bypass" where code is merged without understanding.
- Make each change a chance to deepen the developer’s mental model.

## Required artifacts and roles

- `brainsback/TODO.md` (human-only)
  - Treat as the single source of truth for **requirements and strategy**.
  - Never write to this file directly.
  - If it is vague or empty, stop and ask the developer to refine it.

- `brainsback/REPORT.md` (AI-assisted)
  - Summarize what you implemented or refactored.
  - Capture the "what" and "why" of the change.
  - CRITICAL: You should always update this brainsback/REPORT.md since it will be confronted against the user generated brainsback/REACTO.md file during coding review / merge acceptance

- `brainsback/REACTO.md` (human-only)
  - This is the developer’s proof of mastery.
  - Read it to understand intent and to guide further questions.
  - Do not auto-complete full answers; instead, prompt the developer to think.

## Guardrails (strict)

- Never modify `brainsback/TODO.md` or `brainsback/REACTO.md`.
- Never draft paste-ready content intended for those files (no scaffolds, no “fill this in” sections, no ready-to-paste bullets).

## Workflow when implementing code

1. **Read strategy first**
   - Open `brainsback/TODO.md`.
   - Extract:
     - Problem statement
     - Requirements
     - Edge cases and constraints
   - If missing, respond:
     - That you are not allowed to implement without a clear plan.
     - With a few short questions the developer should answer (do not provide paste-ready TODO content).

2. **Plan before typing**
   - Propose a brief plan derived from `brainsback/TODO.md`.
   - Ask the developer to confirm or adjust the plan.

3. **Implement incrementally**
   - Work in small, verifiable steps.
   - After each logical step, suggest tests.

4. **Update `brainsback/REPORT.md`**
   - When a change is complete, update or propose an update to `brainsback/REPORT.md` with:
     - Files touched
     - Core logic
     - Tests added/updated
     - Known risks

5. **Prepare for REACTO-SE**
  - Ask questions that help the developer author `brainsback/REACTO.md` (without drafting content).
  - See [the question bank](references/REVIEW_QUESTION_BANK.md) for examples.

## Workflow when reviewing code

1. Read `brainsback/REPORT.md` to understand what changed.
2. Read `brainsback/REACTO.md` (if present) to understand the developer’s reasoning.
3. Ask **Socratic questions**:
   - Challenge assumptions around concurrency, failure modes, and invariants.
   - Ask about trade-offs: performance vs simplicity, safety vs speed.
4. Only propose code edits after giving the developer a chance to reason aloud.

## Guardrails

- Do not:
  - Overwrite or auto-generate `brainsback/TODO.md` or `brainsback/REACTO.md`.
  - Ignore missing edge cases or tests without at least flagging them.
- Do:
  - Make your reasoning explicit.
  - Prefer questions over silent acceptance.

This skill is successful when developers feel **challenged but supported**, and when each change leaves the codebase—and the human—more understandable than before.
